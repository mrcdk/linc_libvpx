# linc/libvpx
## EXPERIMENTAL!!!

This is a weekend project, don't expect any support for it.

You will need [libvpx v1.4.0](https://github.com/webmproject/libvpx/tree/v1.4.0) in `lib/libvpx`

You will need to compile the `libvpx` library using `lib/build.sh`

Only tested on linux64

To run the test go to the `test` folder and run
`haxe build.hxml && ./cpp/Test small.webm`
